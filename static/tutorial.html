	<h2>Basic tutorial</h2>
	<h3>1. Creating elements</h3>
	<p>To create instances of elements, drag them from the tool panel on the right to the workspace. Elements display a rounded decimal approximation of their value. However, when elements are stacked, the approximation is <span style="color:red">red</span>, and only the top stacked number is displayed.</p>
	<h3>2. Combining elements</h3>
	<p>Drag and drop an element onto another to combine their values on the stack. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">Wikipedia</a> for more information on stacks.</p>
	<h3>3. Order of Operations</h3>
	<p>To use operators, drop them on top of the proper element in the workspace. Unary operators (L and J) work on the top stack item. Binary operators, including addition and subtraction,
		operate on the top two stack elements</p>
